In order to run these Jupyter notebooks in an interactive environment we use a free software called [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). It creates a virtual JupyterHub server in the cloud that allows these notebooks to be run. In order to launch a Binder environment just click the button above.
