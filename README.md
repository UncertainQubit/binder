# Innovation Center AI Team

Hi! We are the Artitificial Intelligence Team at the Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools. This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks along with related datasets, etc. intended to explain some of the basic concepts of AI. By the end of these notebooks you will be: proficient in analyzing and vidualizing data, knowledgeable about different domains of Machine Learning, able to create advanced deep learning models, and be prepared to compete in our competition to create a Machine Learning model that predicts housing prices in the Boulder County area. Please note that these notebooks are not intended to be a standalone resource at this point but are intended to be supplements to our Innovation Center courses and livestreams and may occasionally reference content covered in these lessons.

# Jupyter Notebook Examples

Below is a list of all our Jupyter notebooks and lessons to date as well as instuctions for how to access them.

In order to run these Jupyter notebooks in an interactive environment we use a free software called [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). It creates a virtual JupyterHub server in the cloud that allows these notebooks to be run. In order to launch a Binder environment just click the button below.

However, Binder is not the only way to access these resources. For a more in depth explanation of the methods summarized below view our first technical livestream.
* Anaconda distribution -> Clone this repository to local directory. Note: requires Git.
* JupyterHub installation -> Clone this repostory to local directory. Note: Requires Git.

If you are part of an Innovation Center class you may alo have a JupyterHub server in which case these notebooks will be regularly updated so you don't have to worry about any of this.

Lessons:
* Introduction to Python
* Lesson #1 & Practice - Data
* Lesson #1 Extension - Data Visualization
