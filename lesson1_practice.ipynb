    "We have included a module called `lesson1_module` for code checking, just leave this code be. When you get to code that looks like `icai.check_#()` run it to receive feedback on your submission. Currently code checking will only tell you whether your code is right or wrong but if you are stuck you can run `icai.hint_#()` to receive a hint or `icai.soln_#()` to receive the solution. Good luck and have fun!"
