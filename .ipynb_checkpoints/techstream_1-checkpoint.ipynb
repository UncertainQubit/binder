    "Today you learned about pandas, one of the most common libraries in data science. It is most commonly used to organize tabular data (data that can be found in table or spreadsheet form) such as housing prices in relation to their features as we will see today. This data is often stored in a type of file called a csv which stands for comma separated values. Essentially, it is a large collection of values separated by commas with headings in the first line as can be seen below.\n",

    "Finding good data is one of the most important jobs for those wishng to create machine learning models. According to Dimensional Research 8 out of 10 AI projects fail, and 96% of those failures are due to a lack of data quality. Free datasets can be found in a number of places online. Often local and federal agencies will have free-to-use datasets as may companies seeking data science expertise. Some good tools to look for datasets include [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) which searches the internet for open-source datasets and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), a free data science platform with over 33,000 datasets and counting created by users. The data we will be using today is from Kaggle, entitled [\"Melbourne Housing Dataset\"](https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market) and created by Kaggle user Tony Pino.\n",
    "\n",
    "To import this dataset we will use the pandas function `read_csv` where our input is a link to the csv holding the data located in a Github repository. Most online datasets will have a file hosted online, if they don't you can either download the dataset to a Github repository (as we've done) or, if you're using an Anaconda distribution on your computer, you can call a file hosted locally, i.e. 'C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\dataset'. We store our dataset as a pandas object called a dataframe (essentially a table) under the variable `df`."

Simply call the `head` function on a dataframe to display the first five rows. If you need to see more you can also add a number inside the paretheses to display that many rows. Below you can see a display of our dataframe."

However, even irregardless of machine learning exploring data can provide powerful, actionable insights. For example, a data scientist may be contracted by a real estate company to find which sellers they should recruit. One way we could approach this problem is to see which sellers sold the most real estate using the `value_counts` function. This function counts the number of times that a value appears in the dataframe.
