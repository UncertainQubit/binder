Often local and federal agencies will have free-to-use datasets as may companies seeking data science expertise. Some good tools to look for datasets include [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) which searches the internet for open-source datasets and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), a free data science platform with over 33,000 datasets and counting created by users.

    "### Basics of Pandas\n",
    "Before you begin to explore your data it is important to understand some of the powerful features contained within pandas. Pandas makes it easy to create dataframes with the command `pd.DataFrame`. There are a few different ways to add data to a dataframe but the most common way that we will use throughout this tutotial is through the use of dictionaries. Dictionaries are a type of object in python that, similar to a dictionary match one value to another. Dictionaries are an easy way to create dataframes because one value provides a column name while its associated values make up the rows. In the example below we create a dictionary consisting of two associations, 'Fruit' along with an array containing the names of fruits and 'Veggies' containing the names of various vegetables."

However, even irregardless of machine learning exploring data can provide powerful, actionable insights. For example, a data scientist may be contracted by a real estate company to find which sellers they should recruit. One way we could approach this problem is to see which sellers sold the most real estate using the `value_counts` function. This function counts the number of times that a value appears in the dataframe. In our case `SellerG` contains the name of the seller of the property, counting this value will tell us how much real estate a seller has sold."
